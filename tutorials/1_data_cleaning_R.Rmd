## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

plot(pressure)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Now, let's try using other libraries

```{r}

library(skimr)
library(palmerpenguins)

skim(penguins)




```


Now, a plot.

Here we use the `palmerpenguins` dataset to plot a scatterplot using a couple of useful packages to make our figures nicer. 

Check this out:

```{r preview, fig.height= 3, fig.width=4}

library(hrbrthemes)
library(wesanderson)

penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(color = species, x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_ipsum_tw() +
  scale_color_manual(values=wes_palette("Darjeeling1")) +
  labs(title = "This is the penguin plot!",
       subtitle = "A plot of a bunch of penguins belonging to different species")


```
